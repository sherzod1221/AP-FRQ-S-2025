# AP-FRQs-2025 
Solutions written by Sherzod Suleymanov

# Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on May 7th. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

# Exam Experience
In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

My preparation strategy for the exam included attending the coding club and tutoring after school from time to time, as well as taking the mock exam and seeing which questions I needed to study up on.
The most challenging aspects of the exam were timing with the multiple choice, I found that pretty difficult to manage my time for the MCQ's however others found it much more manageable.
Time management techniques that worked well for me was, reading the questions first and trying to stay above 2 minutes per question.
Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions was to first read the questions to figure out what you need to do, because some questions while seeming hard and giving you a lot of information, were asking for something simple and quick.
Growth Opportunities - I struggle understanding/reading people's code quickly so I could work on that to also work on my time management better.
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning: 

Topic/Concept 1: Inheritance, sometimes even though the code is right(ish) there could be a compile error because it doesn't see everything correctly, and that could be a bit confusing

Topic/Concept 2: 2D arrays, while a simple concept, flipping through it and changing stuff in it could be a bit confusing, as doing .add or .remove moves all values a place 

Programming practice: Practice harder topics such as Inheritance and 2D arrays once you've mastered simple things because you'll be using those simple things along with the more difficult things.

# Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to:

Continue learning Java, and apply for college for a software engineering major.
I was inspired with the idea of school schedules and how they're made after doing the dogWalk problem on the exam.
Testing and trying out to understand principles in coding is probably the most effective strategy, however since you still need to read other people's code most of the time, practicing solving problems caused intentionally in different programs could also be useful.
